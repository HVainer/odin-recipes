        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>4 (5 ounce) chicken breast cutlets</li>
            <li>1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
            <li>3/4 cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>3/4 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon grated lemon zest</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon roughly chopped fresh basil, plus more for garnish</li>
            <li>lemon slices for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Pat chicken dry on a large plate using paper towels; season all sides of chicken with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. </li>
            <li>Place flour on a separate large plate. Working with 1 cutlet at a time, coat chicken with flour, shake off excess, and return to original plate. Discard any leftover flour. </li>
            <li>Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add chicken; cook until golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest portion of chicken registers 160 degrees F (71 degrees C), 3 to 4 minutes per side, adjusting heat as needed to control browning. Transfer chicken to a large, clean plate; cover with aluminum foil and keep warm.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to low and add garlic and remaining 1 tablespoon oil; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, 10 to 15 seconds.</li>
            <li>Stir in broth, heavy cream, Parmesan, lemon zest, lemon juice, and onion powder, scraping to dissolve any browned bits on bottom of pan; bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook, stirring frequently, until slightly thickened, about 6 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in basil, remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper, then return chicken and any juices to skillet, stirring sauce to help incorporate drippings.  </li>
            <li>Serve immediately with basil and lemon slices.</li>    
        </ol>
